# Future Features

This directory contains design documents and specifications for features that are planned but not yet implemented.

## Continuum UI

[continuum-ui.md](continuum-ui.md) - A declarative UI framework for FluentAI that would provide:
- Physics-based layouts
- Reactive state management  
- 2D/3D rendering contexts
- Compilation to DOM effects

**Status**: Design phase only. The AST nodes (Surface, Space, Element, etc.) exist in the codebase but are currently placeholders that compile to nil values.

## Note on Implementation

These features are not roadmap commitments. They represent ideas that have been explored but may or may not be implemented based on:
- Community interest
- Available resources
- Technical feasibility
- Alignment with core language goals
