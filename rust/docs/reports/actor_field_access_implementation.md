# Actor Self Field Access Implementation Report

## Summary

Implemented self field access in actor handlers, allowing handlers to directly reference actor state fields without explicit state parameter access.

## Changes Made

### 1. Parser Modifications (fluentai-parser/src/flc_parser.rs)

#### Added Actor Context Tracking
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct ActorContext {
    state_fields: Vec<(String, String)>, // (field_name, field_type)
    in_handler: bool,
}
```

#### Modified Parser Structure
- Added `actor_context: Option<ActorContext>` field to Parser struct
- Tracks current actor context during parsing

#### Variable Reference Transformation
In `parse_primary_expression`, when parsing a variable:
- Checks if we're in an actor handler context
- If the variable name matches a state field, transforms it to a getter call
- `count` becomes `get_count(state)`

### 2. Actor Definition Parsing
- Tracks state fields as they're parsed in `parse_actor_definition`
- Sets `in_handler = true` when parsing handler bodies
- Restores previous context after parsing

## Example Transformation

### Before (FLC Source):
```flc
private actor Counter {
    count: int = 0;
    
    private handle Inc(n: int) {
        count + n  // Direct field access
    }
}
```

### After (AST Representation):
The `count` reference is transformed to:
```
Application {
    function: Variable { name: "get_count" },
    args: [Variable { name: "state" }]
}
```

## Tests Added

Created comprehensive test suite in `fluentai-parser/tests/actor_field_access_tests.rs`:
- `test_simple_field_access_in_handler`: Basic field access
- `test_multiple_field_access`: Multiple fields in one handler
- `test_field_access_in_receive_pattern`: Field access within receive blocks
- `test_field_access_with_method_chaining`: Field access followed by method calls
- `test_no_transformation_outside_handler`: Ensures non-handler contexts aren't affected
- `test_field_access_in_conditional`: Field access in if expressions
- `test_field_name_shadowing`: Documents known limitation with local variable shadowing

All tests pass successfully.

## Known Limitations

1. **Variable Shadowing**: If a local variable shadows a field name, the current implementation will still transform it to a field access. This is a known limitation that should be addressed in future iterations.

2. **Getter Function Convention**: The transformation assumes getter functions follow the `get_<field>` naming convention. The actual runtime implementation needs to provide these functions.

3. **Assignment**: This implementation only handles reading field values. Field assignment would require a separate transformation to setter calls.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Proper Scope Tracking**: Implement proper variable scope tracking to handle shadowing correctly.

2. **Setter Transformation**: Add support for field assignment (`count := new_value`).

3. **Direct State Access**: Consider alternative approaches like transforming to `state.count` instead of `get_count(state)`.

4. **Optimization**: The getter calls could be optimized away during compilation if the state representation allows direct field access.
