// Continuum Concept Demo - Shows the idea without full implementation

// This is what you would write in Continuum:
// public state_field count: int = 0
// public surface app {
//     element button {
//         content: "Click me",
//         on_click: disturb count(count + 1)
//     }
// }

// This is what it compiles to (simplified):
let render_count = (n) => {
    perform IO.print("=== Continuum UI Demo ===");
    perform IO.print("Count: " + n);
    perform IO.print("[Click Me Button]");
    perform IO.print("");
    n
};

// Simulate UI interaction
let initial_count = 0;
perform IO.print("Initial render:");
render_count(initial_count);

perform IO.print("After clicking button 3 times:");
let count1 = render_count(initial_count + 1);
let count2 = render_count(count1 + 1); 
let count3 = render_count(count2 + 1);

perform IO.print("Continuum would handle:");
perform IO.print("- Reactive state updates");
perform IO.print("- Automatic re-rendering");
perform IO.print("- Event binding");
perform IO.print("- DOM manipulation");

"Demo complete - count would be: " + count3
