# Continuum UI Examples

These are experimental examples showing how the Continuum UI syntax would work if implemented.

**Note**: Continuum UI is not currently implemented. These examples demonstrate:
- How the parser handles Continuum syntax
- What the compiled output might look like

The AST nodes exist but compile to nil values. See `docs/future/continuum-ui.md` for the full design specification.

## Files

- `parser_test.rs` - Tests parsing of Continuum syntax
- `transpile_continuum.py` - Python script showing potential compilation strategy

These are kept for reference but should not be considered working examples.
