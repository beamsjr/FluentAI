# Continuum UI Framework Status

## Current State (Phase 2 Complete)

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Parser Support**
   - Lexer recognizes all Continuum keywords
   - Parser creates AST nodes for UI constructs
   - Examples parse without errors

2. **AST Integration**
   - New node types: Surface, Space, Element, StateField, When, Disturb
   - Type inference handles them (returns unit type)
   - Optimizer won't crash on them
   - VM accepts them (returns nil)

3. **Examples Created**
   - `continuum_showcase.flc` - Full task management app
   - `continuum_simple_demo.flc` - Basic counter
   - `continuum_compilation_demo.flc` - Shows transformation

## ❌ What's Not Working Yet:

### Phase 3 - Compiler Lowering (Not Started)
The Continuum syntax needs to be transformed into regular FluentAI code:

```flc
// Continuum syntax:
public state_field count: int = 0

public surface app {
    element button {
        content: "Click me",
        on_click: disturb count(count + 1)
    }
}
```

Should compile to:

```flc
// FluentAI code:
let count = create_state(0);

let render = () => {
    perform Dom.create_element("button", {
        "content": "Click me",
        "onclick": () => {
            count.set(count.get() + 1);
            render();
        }
    });
};

render();
```

## How to Run Continuum Demos

**You can't run them yet!** The compiler lowering phase is missing.

### What happens if you try:
```bash
./target/debug/fluentai run examples/continuum_showcase.flc
# Result: The parser accepts it, but VM returns nil for Continuum nodes
```

### To make them work, we need to:

1. **Implement `continuum_lowering.rs`**
   - Transform Surface → Dom.create_surface() 
   - Transform Element → Dom.create_element()
   - Transform StateField → state management code
   - Transform Disturb → state updates + re-render

2. **Add Dom effect handlers to VM**
   - Handle Dom.create_element
   - Handle Dom.update_element
   - Handle Dom.remove_element

3. **Create runtime support**
   - State management helpers
   - Event binding system
   - Re-render scheduling

## Workaround Examples

See these files for how Continuum *would* work:
- `examples/continuum_explained.flc` - Explains the concepts
- `examples/continuum_status.flc` - Current implementation status
- `examples/simple_working_demo.flc` - Regular FluentAI syntax that works today

## Next Steps

1. Complete the `ContinuumLowering` pass in `fluentai-optimizer/src/passes/continuum_lowering.rs`
2. Add the pass to the optimization pipeline
3. Implement Dom effects in the VM
4. Test with simple examples
5. Build the WebAssembly runtime

## For Developers

The Continuum UI framework is designed to compile away completely. It's a zero-cost abstraction that transforms declarative UI syntax into efficient imperative code. The parser phase is complete, but the compiler transformation is the critical missing piece.
