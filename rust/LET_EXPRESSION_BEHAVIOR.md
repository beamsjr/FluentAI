# Let Expression Behavior in FLC Parser

## Summary

The FLC parser correctly handles `let` expressions with multiple expressions in the body when using explicit blocks with curly braces.

## Test Results

### 1. Let with Explicit Block (WORKS ✓)

```flc
let x = 5; {
    perform IO.print("First");
    perform IO.print("Second");
    x + 10
}
```

**Result**: Parses correctly as:
- `Let` node with:
  - Binding: `x = 5`
  - Body: `Begin` node containing 3 expressions

### 2. Let without Block (Different Behavior)

```flc
let x = 5;
perform IO.print("First");
perform IO.print("Second");
x + 10
```

**Result**: Parses as separate top-level expressions:
- Root is a `Begin` node with multiple expressions
- The `let x = 5;` is treated as a complete statement
- Subsequent lines are separate expressions at the same level

### 3. Nested Let with Blocks (WORKS ✓)

```flc
let x = 5; {
    let y = 10; {
        perform IO.print("Nested");
        x + y
    }
}
```

**Result**: Correctly nests the let expressions with their respective block bodies.

### 4. Let with Semicolon-Separated Expressions (WORKS ✓)

```flc
let x = 5; {
    x + 1;
    x + 2;
    x + 3
}
```

**Result**: The block body is a `Begin` node with 3 expressions.

## Key Findings

1. **Multiple expressions in let bodies require explicit blocks** - Use `let x = value; { expr1; expr2; ... }` syntax
2. **Without blocks, semicolons terminate the let expression** - `let x = 5;` is a complete statement
3. **The parser correctly handles nested blocks and sequences**
4. **The AST uses `Begin` nodes to represent sequences of expressions**

## Recommendation

Always use explicit blocks when you want multiple expressions in a let body:

```flc
// Correct way to have multiple expressions in let body
let result = compute_value(); {
    perform IO.print("Computed value");
    perform State.set(result);
    result * 2
}
```

Without the explicit block, each line after the semicolon is parsed as a separate top-level expression, not as part of the let body.
