## Performance Tracking Methodology

### 1. Baseline Capture
```python
# Automated baseline capture
- Parser: 19-212µs depending on complexity
- Interpreter: 13-3,160µs for operations
- VM: 3.2µs for simple arithmetic
```

### 2. Continuous Benchmarking
```bash
# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Compare with Python
python3 tools/compare_parsers.py

# View dashboard
python3 tools/performance_dashboard.py
```

### 3. Regression Prevention
- CI/CD integration planned
- Automatic performance alerts
- Historical trend tracking

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Complete Python Bindings**
   - Fix PyO3 linking issues
   - Measure FFI overhead
   - Ensure API compatibility

2. **Begin VM Implementation**
   - Port bytecode format
   - Implement core opcodes
   - Benchmark vs Python VM

### Short Term (Weeks 2-4)
1. **VM Completion**
   - All opcodes implemented
   - GC integration
   - 20-30x speedup target

2. **LSP Implementation**
   - Incremental parsing
   - Parallel analysis
   - <10ms response target

### Medium Term (Weeks 5-8)
1. **JIT Compiler**
   - LLVM integration
   - Type specialization
   - 5-10x additional speedup

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation
   - Release preparation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **FFI Overhead**: Python bindings may add latency
   - Mitigation: Batch operations, minimize crossings

2. **Memory Usage**: Rust may use more memory
   - Mitigation: Arena allocation, object pooling

3. **Complexity**: Maintaining two implementations
   - Mitigation: Shared test suite, gradual migration

## Conclusion

The Rust migration has exceeded initial expectations with the parser achieving 99x average speedup. This validates our approach and demonstrates that the 10-20x overall performance target is achievable. The infrastructure is in place for systematic migration of remaining components while maintaining quality and compatibility.
